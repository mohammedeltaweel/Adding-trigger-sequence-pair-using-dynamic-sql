# Adding-trigger-sequence-pair-using-dynamic-sql
Using dynamic SQL, I've added a trigger/sequence pair to automate the insertion of all primary keys in all tables in any certain schema (HR in this case)
The objective of this project is to make the primary key of each table increment automatically by 5 if it is a number that can be incremented.
